# steamdeck-overlays
Retroarch overlays for the steam deck, sized at 1200x800

The "sources" folder holds any source files - photoshop files, paint.net files, paint shop pro files, etc - that are available for the sets. 

Each set has its own Readme that specifies clearly where the set was found or where it was modified from.

If you'd like to contribute some steamdeck overlays to this collection, use a pull request or send me a message!
